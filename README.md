### Contributing

Anyone is welcome to contribute by creating an issue or pull request to this repo. Alternate methods for those without a GitHub account will be made available soon. 

Guidlines for links:

- The whole list, including the category list and these guidelines, is open to contributions and suggestions
- The focus of the list is on resources for the creation and publishing of tabletop games. Contributions of resources for players to run and create content for their game sessions will be (politely) turned down. This is an understandably a gray area, but the bias is to not include links of this kind. Links only relevant for video game production will not be accepted
- Suggested links should include a title, a URL, a short (one line) description, and a suggested category. If possible, include the name and link to the author(s) of the resource as well
- URLs should be direct links to the site, article, etc. Please no page redirects, affiliate links, URL shorteners, etc. Any non-necessary URL parameters (such as campaign or tracking params) should be removed. URLs that require a log-in to reach will not be accepted
